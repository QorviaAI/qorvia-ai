write my prospective as Product line manager in telco AI cloud business """"Your feature roadmap is derailed by urgent stakeholder requests. How do you regain control and stay on track?
Unexpected stakeholder demands can derail even the most meticulously planned feature roadmap. To steer back on course:

- Assess impact and prioritize: Evaluate how new requests align with your strategic goals and prioritize accordingly.

- Communicate transparently: Keep stakeholders informed about the implications of shifts in priorities.

- Set boundaries and negotiate: Establish clear limits on when to accommodate requests and advocate for your original plan.

How do you balance urgent requests with your product vision? Share your strategies.""""

Perspective as a Product Line Manager in the Telco AI Cloud Business

In the dynamic and fast-paced telco AI cloud domain, managing competing priorities and balancing urgent requests with long-term product vision is critical. Here’s how I tackle such situations:

Assess the Impact Strategically:

I begin by evaluating how the new requests align with our product vision and broader business objectives, such as improving network efficiency, enhancing customer experience, or driving revenue growth.
For example, if the request involves an AI-powered optimization feature that addresses an immediate pain point for a major telecom client, it may warrant high priority.
I also consider resource allocation and the potential impact on existing commitments, especially for critical initiatives like near-real-time RIC apps or energy-saving applications.
Engage Stakeholders Transparently:

Regular communication is key. I ensure stakeholders understand the trade-offs of reprioritizing tasks—be it a delay in delivering AI/ML-based automation for network slicing or a postponed enhancement for RU optimization.
By framing discussions around data and outcomes, I can highlight how proposed changes may affect our long-term goals, such as maintaining competitive edge in 6G innovations or AI-driven SON applications.
Set Boundaries and Negotiate Solutions:

I establish clear processes for handling urgent requests, such as creating a “rapid-response task force” to address high-impact needs without disrupting the entire roadmap.
For instance, if a sudden demand emerges for a feature related to Open RAN compliance, I might propose a phased delivery approach—addressing urgent components first while keeping the rest of the roadmap intact.
Balance and Adapt:

The key is to remain agile without losing sight of the big picture. For every urgent task accepted, I identify an equivalent trade-off to ensure the roadmap stays balanced.
Tools like AI-driven scenario planning can be invaluable here, enabling me to model the impact of changes in real-time and make informed decisions.
Example Strategy in Action:
When managing the development of RIC-based applications, I encountered a last-minute request for a feature integrating UAV use cases into our rApp portfolio. While urgent, the request aligned with a strategic goal to expand into emerging 6G markets. By re-scoping less critical deliverables, I accommodated the request while ensuring no compromise on long-term objectives like energy efficiency and platform scalability.

Open Question to Colleagues:
How do you integrate agility into your product management processes without sacrificing long-term vision? Let’s share strategies for striking this balance.

blog on esim """The ubiquitous SIM card has played a fundamental role in mobile telecommunications for over 25 years. It is recognised by end users and provides a secure means for authenticating devices onto networks, all inside a removable “Secure Element”, which is easily transferrable between mobile devices.

Although the role of the SIM itself is not changing, the GSMA has defined a radical new way to load it into devices. Now the SIM may be securely downloaded into a ‘Secure Element’ that can be permanently embedded inside any type of device. To enable this change, an ecosystem of trusted platforms and players has been facilitated by the GSMA to create the eSIM solution. It offers an equivalent level of security and protection to that provided by the removable SIM card.

ChatGPT
If you're facing issues with not receiving the email ID after purchasing a GoDaddy Professional Email Individual plan, here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve the problem:

1. Confirm the Purchase
Log in to your GoDaddy account.
Navigate to My Products from the dashboard.
Check if the email plan appears under the Email & Office section.
Ensure the purchase was completed successfully and payment has been processed.
2. Set Up the Email Address
If the email plan is listed, but the email ID hasn't been created yet:

Click on the Set Up button next to the email plan.
Follow the on-screen instructions to:
Assign a domain to the email.
Choose your desired email address (e.g., info@yourdomain.com).
Set a password for the email account.
3. Check the Email Dashboard
If the email address was already set up but you're not able to use it:

Go to the Email & Office Dashboard from your GoDaddy account.
Check the status of the email account (it might be pending or provisioning).
Wait for a few minutes or refresh the page if the status indicates "Processing."
4. Verify Your Domain
If the domain linked to the email hasn't been verified, the email account won't work. Ensure:

Your domain is correctly linked to GoDaddy.
You have updated the DNS records (MX, CNAME, and TXT) as instructed in the setup process. This ensures the domain points to GoDaddy's email servers.
5. Check Spam or Promotions Folder
If you're expecting an email from GoDaddy but haven't received it:

Check your spam, junk, or promotions folder.
Add godaddy.com to your safe sender list.
6. Contact GoDaddy Support
If none of the above steps resolve the issue, reach out to GoDaddy's customer support:

Chat Support: Available 24/7 on the GoDaddy Support Page.
Phone Support: Call the local support number for assistance.
7. Alternative Action
If you're unable to proceed with the GoDaddy email setup, you can:

Cancel the purchase and request a refund through GoDaddy’s refund policy.
Consider alternative professional email solutions like Google Workspace or Microsoft 365, which also integrate with GoDaddy domains.
Let me know if you need help with any of these steps!






You said:
getting this error https://ox.godaddy.com/?del_code=1
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The error you’re encountering (https://ox.godaddy.com/?del_code=1) is typically related to GoDaddy's email setup or configuration process. It occurs when there’s an issue with accessing your Professional Email (OX Email) service.

Here’s how you can troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

1. Check Domain Connection
This error might happen if your domain is not properly connected to the email service. Follow these steps:

Log in to your GoDaddy Account.
Navigate to My Products > Email & Office.
Ensure that your domain is properly assigned to the email account you purchased.
If it’s not assigned, follow the setup instructions to assign your domain to the email service.
2. Update DNS Records
Your domain’s DNS records (MX, CNAME, TXT) must point to GoDaddy’s email servers for the email service to work:

Log in to your GoDaddy Account.
Go to My Products > Domains > DNS.
Add or verify the following DNS records:
MX Record:
vbnet
Copy code
Host: @
Points to: smtp.secureserver.net
Priority: 0
CNAME Record:
vbnet
Copy code
Host: email
Points to: email.secureserver.net
TXT Record (optional for domain verification):
makefile
Copy code
Host: @
Value: v=spf1 include:secureserver.net -all
Save the changes and wait for the propagation (usually 30 minutes to 24 hours).
3. Clear Browser Cache and Cookies
Cached data might interfere with the OX email login. Clear your browser cache and cookies:

Open your browser settings.
Navigate to Privacy and Security.
Clear browsing data, including cached images and cookies.
After clearing the cache, restart your browser and try accessing the email service again via:
https://ox.godaddy.com

4. Reset the Email Account
If the issue persists:

Go to Email & Office Dashboard in your GoDaddy account.
Delete and recreate the email account:
Click Manage next to your email plan.
Delete the email account (if it exists) and set it up again with your desired email address.
Reconfigure the DNS records if necessary.
5. Use a Different Browser or Device
Sometimes browser or device compatibility issues may prevent access. Try logging in with a different:

Browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
Device (e.g., mobile phone, another computer).
6. Contact GoDaddy Support
If you’ve completed the above steps and still encounter the error, reach out to GoDaddy’s customer support for direct assistance:

Chat Support: Available 24/7 at GoDaddy Support Page.
Phone Support: Call your regional support number (found on their Help page).

Step 2: Update styles.css
css
Copy code
/* Background Image */
.background-section {
  background: url('background-image.png') no-repeat center center/cover;
  height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  text-align: center;
  color: white;
}

/* Floating eSIM Images */
.floating-esim {
  position: fixed;
  animation: float 6s ease-in-out infinite;
  z-index: 1000;
  pointer-events: none; /* Prevent interference with clicks */
}
#floating-esim-1 {
  top: 20%;
  left: 10%;
  width: 200px; /* Increase size */
}
#floating-esim-2 {
  bottom: 15%;
  right: 15%;
  width: 250px; /* Increase size */
}

.floating-esim img {
  width: 100%;
  filter: drop-shadow(0px 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2));
}

/* Floating Animation Keyframes */
@keyframes float {
  0%, 100% {
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
  50% {
    transform: translateY(-20px);
  }
}

/* Contact Section */
#contact {
  padding: 2rem;
  text-align: center;
}
#contact p a {
  color: #004080;
  text-decoration: none;
  font-weight: bold;
}
Step 3: Update script.js
Add functionality to enhance the floating effect or handle dynamic updates.

javascript
Copy code
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const floatingEsims = document.querySelectorAll('.floating-esim');
  floatingEsims.forEach((esim, index) => {
    const delay = index * 2; // Stagger animation start
    esim.style.animationDelay = `${delay}s`;
  });

  // Form Submission Alert
  const contactForm = document.getElementById('contact-form');
  if (contactForm) {
    contactForm.addEventListener('submit', (e) => {
      e.preventDefault();
      alert('Thank you for contacting Qorvia! We will respond soon.');
    });
  }
});
Step 4: Add Assets
Ensure the following files are added to your project directory:

background-image.png – Generated background picture.
floating-esim-1.png – Larger version of the eSIM illustration.
floating-esim-2.png – Alternative version of the eSIM illustration.
Step 5: Deploy the Website
Option 1: Using GitHub Pages
Create a GitHub repository and upload all files (index.html, styles.css, script.js, and assets).
Go to Settings > Pages and set the source branch.
Access your site at https://<username>.github.io/<repository>.
Option 2: Using Netlify
Log in to Netlify.
Drag-and-drop your project folder into the dashboard.
Use the provided URL to share your live site.
Result
Your updated website will:

Include a background picture for the hero section.
Display two floating, enlarged eSIM illustrations with motion.
Showcase the qorvia@qorvia.ai email prominently in the contact section.
Let me know if you’d like further enhancements!
